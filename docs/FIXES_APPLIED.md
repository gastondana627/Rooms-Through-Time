# 🔧 Core Issues Fixed

## ✅ Chatbot Widget Issue
**Problem**: Widget was closing immediately after sending message
**Fix**: Removed `setShowChatInput(false)` from chat handler - now stays open to show response

## ✅ Before/After Slider Timing
**Problem**: Showing after first image generation (confusing)
**Fix**: Now only shows after 3D reconstruction is complete - makes perfect sense!

## ✅ 3D vs Original Comparison
**Problem**: No way to compare 3D model with original image
**Fix**: Added comparison button in 3D controls + side-by-side overlay showing original image

## ✅ Chatbot During Loading
**Problem**: Chat button disappeared during 3D construction
**Fix**: Chat button now available during loading states - can chat while 3D is processing

## ✅ Local-First Architecture
**Problem**: Needed cloud keys to work
**Fix**: Everything works perfectly without cloud keys, cloud is just enhancement
